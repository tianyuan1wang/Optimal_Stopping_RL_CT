# Optimal_Stopping_RL_CT
This repository contains the code for the Dynamic Angle Selection in X-Ray CT: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimal Stopping project.
## Project Overview
In industrial X-ray Computed Tomography (CT), the need for rapid in-line inspection is critical. Sparse-angle tomography plays a significant role in this by reducing the required number of projections, thereby accelerating processing and conserving resources. Most existing methods aim to balance reconstruction quality and scanning time, typically relying on fixed scan durations. Adaptive adjustment of the number of angles is essential; for instance, more angles may be required for objects with complex geometries or noisier projections. The concept of optimal stopping, which dynamically adjusts this balance according to varying industrial needs, remains overlooked. Building on our previous work, we integrate optimal stopping into sequential Optimal Experimental Design (sOED) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). We propose a novel method for computing the policy gradient within the Actor-Critic framework, enabling the development of adaptive policies for informative angle selection and scan termination. Additionally, we investigate the gap between simulation and real-world applications in the context of the developed learning-based method. Our trained model, developed using synthetic data, demonstrates reliable performance when applied to experimental X-ray CT data. This approach enhances the flexibility of CT operations and expands the applicability of sparse-angle tomography in industrial settings.
